        "why": "The approach is to create a Service Account and grant it the permissions the resources (e g. the VMs) need. Then you create the VMs to use the Service Account as their identity. Resources have a single identity, usually a Service Account. You should create Service Accounts for each functionally|security equivalent resource. Identities are bound to one or more roles. Roles correspond to one of our more service|API methods. Try to use predefined roles but you can create custom roles."
